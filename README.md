## Installation

Install the plugin via composer:

```bash
composer require monsieurbiz/sylius-settings-plugin
```

<details><summary>For the installation without flex, follow these additional steps</summary>
<p>

Change your `config/bundles.php` file to add this line for the plugin declaration:
```php
<?php

return [
    //..
    MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\MonsieurBizSyliusSettingsPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];  
```

Copy the plugin configuration files in your `config` folder: 
```bash  
cp -Rv vendor/monsieurbiz/sylius-settings-plugin/recipes/1.0-dev/config/ config
```

</p>
</details>  

Update your database:

```bash 
bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate
```

Continue to "[How it works](#how-it-works)" to add your first setting for your store.

*Note:* you may encounter an error during the installation via composer if you let it run the scripts.  
Copy the configuration files and rerun the `composer require`, it should work. This is due to the use of other plugins in the DI.
The configuration is then required to run any console command.

## How it works

As a good start you can have a look at:

- The [configuration file](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/config/packages/monsieurbiz_settings_plugin_custom.yaml) to add your own settings.
- The [form with your own fields](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/src/Form/SettingsType.php).

Then you can get your settings using a twig function: `setting()`.  
Have a look at [this example](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/templates/views/message.html.twig).

You can also use the DI to get your Settings, as example with the settings in the test Application `app.default`:

```bash
$ ./bin/console debug:container | grep app.settings.default
  MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\Settings $defaultSettings                    alias for "app.settings.default"
  MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\SettingsInterface $defaultSettings           alias for "app.settings.default"
  app.settings.default                                                                   MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\Settings
```

*Note:* the "Settings" menu won't appear until you have at least one setting.
