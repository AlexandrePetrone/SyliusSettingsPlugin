## Installation

**‚ö†Ô∏è This plugin is not released yet.**

‚öôÔ∏è To Be Defined

A few steps to start:

- Require the plugin via composer (`composer require monsieurbiz/sylius-settings-plugin="@rc" --no-scripts`).
- Edit the `config/bundles.php` (`MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\MonsieurBizSyliusSettingsPlugin::class => ['all' => true],`).
- Copy the config (`cp -Rv vendor/monsieurbiz/sylius-settings-plugin/recipes/1.0-dev/config/ config/`).
- Run the diff in your migrations (`./bin/console doctrine:migration:diff`).
- Execute the migrations (`./bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate`).
- Continue to "[How it works](#how-it-works)".

Note: you may encounter an error during the installation via composer if you let it run the scripts.  
Copy the configuration files and rerun the `composer require`, it should work. This is due to the use of other plugins in the DI.
The configuration is then required to run any console command.

<!--

**Beware!**

> This installation instruction assumes that you're using Symfony Flex.

1. Require the plugin using composer

    ```bash
    composer require monsieurbiz/sylius-settings-plugin
    ```

2. Generate & Run Doctrine migrations

    ```
    ./bin/console doctrine:migration:diff
    ./bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate
    ```
-->

## How it works

‚öôÔ∏è To Be Defined.

As a good start you can have a look to:

- The [configuration file](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/config/packages/monsieurbiz_settings_plugin_custom.yaml) to add your own settings.
- The [form with your own fields](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/src/Form/SettingsType.php).

Then you can get your settings using a twig function: `setting()`.  
Have a look to [this example](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusSettingsPlugin/blob/master/tests/Application/templates/views/message.html.twig).

You can also use the DI to get your Settings, as example with the settings in the test Application `app.default`:

```bash
$ ./bin/console debug:container | grep app.settings.default
  MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\Settings $defaultSettings                    alias for "app.settings.default"
  MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\SettingsInterface $defaultSettings           alias for "app.settings.default"
  app.settings.default                                                                   MonsieurBiz\SyliusSettingsPlugin\Settings\Settings
```

Note: the "Settings" menu won't appear until you have at least one setting.
